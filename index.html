       <h3 class="section__title section__title--about">Part 1: What Ants Do</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>Provide nutrients for your garden and soil health with decomposition and tilling.</li>
         <li>Actually do pest control by feeding on ticks, termites, and stinkbugs.</li>
         <li>Disperse seeds and create new infrastructure on yards through ant hills.
         <li>Help aerate soil through their complex tunnel systems.</li>
         <li>Attract other life nearby for a backyard party. <br>The mere presence of ants is an indicator of a healthy ecosystem. <br></li>
       </ul>

        <h3 class="section__title section__title--about">Part 2: What Ants Eat</h3>
        <p>Ants are <strong>omnivores</strong>, they will breakdown eat anything they find. Although they can eat anything workers who have to carry around items and food 20 times their body weight prefer to eat decaying or dead sources of protein to give them the needed energy.</p>
        <br>
         
        <h3 class="section__title section__title--about">Part 3: Classification of Ants</h3>
        <p>Ants consist of a single family, <em>Formicidae</em>. They have evolved from wasp ancestors during the Cretaceous period and are characterized by their elbowed antennae and unique node like structure around their slender waists. They are also <strong>insects</strong> with a chitinous exoskeleton and a three part body composing of a head thorax and abdomen complete with three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and a pair of antennae. Ants are from the order <em>Hymenoptera</em> which means they develop through holometabolisms meaning they have a larval stage and an inactive pupal stage before maturity. </p>

      <h2 class="section__title section__title--ants">Types of Ants</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Here are my favourites:</p>
      <h3>Solenopsis Fugax</h3>
      <p>This <em>thief ant</em>, widespread in Europe, found in north temperate amd subtropical environments will steal the young of the Tapinoma ants to eat. When they find a brood chamber, they will release pheromones that repel the other ants forcing them to run while they abscond the young <em>to be eaten alive</em>. Their poison is enough to keep other worker ants from <strong>18 different species</strong> away for up to an hour.</p>
      <h3>Formica archboldi</h3>
      <p>These ants abundant in north Florida will use chemically similar odors to infiltrate trap jaw worker ants and spray a powerful acid to paralyze them. In which they dismember and store them in their nest. They literally <strong>collect the heads of their enemies.</strong></p>
      <h3>Formica paralugubris</h3>
      <p>AKA <em>hairy wood ants</em> live in dense groups in warm, humid, environments with dead insects making them target for widespread disease. To avoid epidemics they groom each other and even collect a <em>antimicrobial</em> tree resin back to their nest to help the injured. These are found in upland conifer and mixed conifer forests along with deciduous woodlands in northern Eurasia.</p>
